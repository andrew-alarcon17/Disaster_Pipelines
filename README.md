# Disaster_Pipelines

## You can view the webpage version of this project via this [Heroku Link](https://disaster-pipeline-app17.herokuapp.com/)

### Motivation

Messages involving disasters were used in a machine learning pipeline in order to classify whether they involved occurences such as storms, hurricanes, transportation, etc. On the web app, a message can be inputed in the navigation bar in order to classify which of the 36 categories the message falls under.

### Data Description
Disaster related messages were provided by Figure Eight and Udacity.

### Folders:

#### App Folder
Contains the html templates and run.py files to display correctly for the heroku web app.

#### Data Folder
Contains the csv files where the data is stored. The process.py file cleans up and pre processes the data and is then stored in a SQLite database.

#### Models Folder
Contains the train_classifer.py file which builds, trains, evaluates, and saves the model to a pkl file.

### Project Structure
*Note that the jupyter files in the data and model folders are included to better understand the direction of the ETL and ML sections of this project.*
